;; PERF: Disable bidirectional text scanning for a modest performance boost.
;;   I've set this to `nil' in the past, but the `bidi-display-reordering's
;;   docs say that is an undefined state and suggest this to be just as good:

;; PERF: Disabling BPA makes redisplay faster, but might produce incorrect
;;   reordering of bidirectional text with embedded parentheses (and other
;;   bracket characters whose 'paired-bracket' Unicode property is non-nil).

;; regions in non-focused windows.

;; spells of inaccurate syntax highlighting right after scrolling, which should
;; quickly self-correct.

;; Emacs "updates" its ui more often than it needs to, so slow it down slightly

;; Font compacting can be terribly expensive, especially for rendering icon
;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
;; hasn't been determined, but do it anyway, just in case. This increases
;; memory usage, however!
(setq inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)

;; Introduced in Emacs HEAD (b2f8c9f), this inhibits fontification while
;; receiving input, which should help a little with scrolling performance.
