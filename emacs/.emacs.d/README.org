This is my literate Emacs configuration file. It serves as both documentation
and the source for configuring Emacs. All necessary files to configure Emacs
are generated from this file by calling ~org-babel-tangle~ (~C-c C-v t~) and stored
in the =/modules= sub-directory. As such, changes should be made in this
document, not in the individual =.el= files.

*N.B.* This configuration uses ~setopt~, introduced in Emacs 29.1, in preference to ~setq~.

*N.B.* According to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][Emacs manual]], byte-compiling the init does not speed-up
startup very much, and often leads to problems when you forget to recompile the
file. Also, from my experience, it may lead to bugs that do not happen when not
using byte-compile.
