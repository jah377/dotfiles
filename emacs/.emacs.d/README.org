#+TITLE: My GNU Emacs Configuration

#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :results silent :mkdirp yes
#+STARTUP: overview

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:visibility: folded
:END:

This is my literate Emacs configuration file. It serves as both documentation
and the source for configuring Emacs. All necessary files to configure Emacs
are generated from this file by calling ~org-babel-tangle~ (~C-c C-v t~) and stored
in the =/modules= sub-directory. As such, changes should be made in this
document, not in the individual =.el= files.

*N.B.* This configuration uses ~setopt~, introduced in Emacs 29.1, in preference to ~setq~.

*N.B.* According to the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][Emacs manual]], byte-compiling the init does not speed-up
startup very much, and often leads to problems when you forget to recompile the
file. Also, from my experience, it may lead to bugs that do not happen when not
using byte-compile.

* Early Init File
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle early-init.el
:END:

The =early-init.el= file, introduced with Emacs27, is the first file that Emacs
reads when starting up. In principal, the early initialization file should
set-up a few basic things before Emacs produces the initial frame, and should
not depend on any packages.

#+end_src

** TODO Define Cloud Storage Location

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Temporarily Configure Garbage Collection
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       19407840-a20f-4225-9484-bbf88d3ff00d
:END:

=gc-cons-threshold= setting controls the number of bytes required to trigger
garbage collection (GC); =gc-cons-percentage= related. Setting to
~most-positive-fixnum~ effectively disables GC, which significantly affects
startup times.

Values are lowered after startup to prevent freezing or crashing.

            (setopt gc-cons-threshold (* 16 1024 1024))))

;; Perform GC after startup
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda () (garbage-collect)))
#+end_src

** Disable Frame Resizing

=frame-inhibit-implied-resize= setting, when set to ~t~, prevents Emacs from
automatically resizing the frame during the initialization process.

Configuring visual elements like font or fringes may trigger Eamcs to resize
the frame in order to preserver a number of columns or lines it
displays. Resizing can be a terribly expensive part of changing the font. By
inhibiting this, it is possible to reduce startup times with fonts that are
larger than the system default.

+ [[https://github.com/MArpogaus/emacs.d?tab=readme-ov-file#optimize-startup-time][github.com/MArpogaus]]

*IMPORTANT:* This should be configured before [[id:534b1a9a-e956-42b1-bf81-40b4e82b2c8e][Disable UI Elements]] and [[id:1360c936-229c-44fd-b71c-30f66960d23a][UI]] sections

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)
#+end_src

Similarly, =frame-resize-pixelwise= setting, when set to ~t~, disables Emacs from
resizing the frame when changing fonts. Doing so /allegedly/ improves startup
times when fonts are larger than the system default.

** Disable UI Elements
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       534b1a9a-e956-42b1-bf81-40b4e82b2c8e
:END:

Remove unnecessary visual elements not only enhances the aesthetics but also
improves startup speed.

              initial-buffer-choice t)     ; Open '*scratch*' buffer
#+end_src

** Disable (Some) Warnings

=warning-suppress-types= setting controls the messages sent to =*Warnings*=
buffer. Here, we ignore warnings about "existing variables being aliased",
which are triggered when Emacs packages do not come with =lexical-bindings=.

*Source:*
+ [[https://github.com/Thaodan/emacs.d][github.com/Thaodan]]
+ [[https://github.com/MArpogaus/emacs.d?tab=readme-ov-file#optimize-startup-time][github.com/MArpogaus]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt warning-suppress-types '((defvaralias) (lexical-binding)))
#+end_src

*N.B.* Including ~;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-~ at the top of Emacs lisp files is
essential for controlling how variable bindings work in the code.

** Doom Runtime Optimizations

=Doom Emacs= contains a number of setting configurations to improve runtime
performance. The following was copied from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/da3d0687c5008edbbe5575ac1077798553549a6a/lisp/doom-start.el#L30][doom-start.el]].

* Init File
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle init.el
:END:

The =init.el= serves as the primary configuration file. Most settings and
configurations are organized in separate 'modules/init-*.el' files and loaded
at the end of this file.

** Profile Emacs Startup
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1269b427-94e9-4df5-98bf-c83a31db096d
:END:

This custom code computes general startup statistics and returns them in
=*scratch*=. This is possible based on our configuration of =initial-buffer-choice=
and =initial-scratch-message= settings in the [[id:534b1a9a-e956-42b1-bf81-40b4e82b2c8e][Disable UI Elements]] section.

*N.B.* If ~use-pacakge-compute statistics t~ (set in [[id:a4fb8525-6004-4685-b4cc-297699db426e][Setup Use-Package]]), calling
~M-x use-package-report~ opens temporary buffer containing package-specific
initialization times.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Package Setup
*** Initialize Package Resources

Here, we setup package management, specify desired package archives, and
prioritize them for efficient package installation/updates.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Required for managing external packages
(require 'package)

(setopt package-archives
      '(("gnu elpa"  . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
        ("melpa"     . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
        ("nongnu"    . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/"))
      package-archive-priorities
      '(("melpa"    . 6)
        ("gnu elpa" . 5)
        ("nongnu"   . 4)))

;; MANDITORY: Emacs must be aware of available packages before installing
(package-initialize)
#+end_src

*** Setup Use-Package
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a4fb8525-6004-4685-b4cc-297699db426e
:END:

=use-package= is an Emacs macro (added in Emacs29) designed to simplify and
optimize the configuration and management of Emacs packages.

It is possible to minimize startup time by selectively loading packages _when
needed_. The macro provides several ways to /defer/ package loading times (~:demand
t~ loads the package immediately):

+ :hook :: Loaded after hook invoked for the first time
+ :bind, :bind-keymap :: Loaded after keybinding used for first time
+ :commands :: Loaded after specified command is used
+ :mode :: Loaded after file with specific extension is opened
+ :after :: Loaded after other specific packages are loaded
+ :defer t :: Defer loading until after startup

If ~use-package-compute-statistics t~, calling ~M-x use-package-report~ will
display whether the package is:

+ Configured :: ~:config~ has been processed (ie. loaded)
+ Initialized :: ~:init~ has been processed (but not loaded)
+ Declared :: Not loaded or initialized

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Ensures backwards compatability; 'use-package' added in Emacs29
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-install 'use-package))

;; Automatically install package if package not already installed
(require 'use-package-ensure)
(setopt use-package-always-ensure t)

;; Track load times and return loading/installation output messages
(setopt use-package-compute-statistics t
        use-package-verbose t)
#+end_src

*** Set Load-Path For Custom Packages

Custom packages stored in =~/.emacs.d/lisp=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((default-directory (expand-file-name "lisp" user-emacs-directory)))
  (unless (file-directory-p default-directory)
    (make-directory default-directory t))
  (add-to-list 'load-path default-directory)
  (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))
#+end_src

** Tidy Emacs Directory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a0a6ce0f-55d9-415f-a70c-48716e9d8c61
:END:

=no-littering= is an Emacs package designed to organize =.emacs.d= and prevent
clutter from various configuration files and cached data. By default,
configuration and data files in =/etc= and =/var= sub-directories, respectively, of
~user-emacs-directory~. This is advantageous as default paths used to store these
items may not be consistent across Emacs packages.

*N.B.* Emacs stores customization information in =custom.el=. Here, we move that
file to =/etc= and load.

*N.B.* Customizations and data files frequently change. Therefore, we will store
that information in the cloud and not in the repo.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package no-littering
  :demand t
  :init
  (setopt no-littering-etc-directory (expand-file-name "no-littering" user-settings-path))
  (setopt no-littering-var-directory (expand-file-name "no-littering" user-settings-path))
  :config
  (setopt custom-file (no-littering-expand-etc-file-name "custom.el"))
  (load custom-file :no-error-if-file-is-missing))
#+end_src

* Emacs

:header-args: :tangle modules/init-emacs.el
:END:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :comments no
<<header(FILENAME="init-emacs.el")>>
#+end_src

** Frame
*** Frame Size

=default-frame-alist= setting specifies parameters of an Emacs frame. Adding
~'(fullscreen . maximized)~ configures Emacs to automatically open in
full-screen.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))
#+end_src

*** Frame Title

=frame-title-format= setting specifies the template for displaying the title bar
of visible Emacs frames. Here, we set it to read ~emacs: <file-name>~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt frame-title-format
        '("emacs: "
          (:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
                     (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name)) "%b"))))
#+end_src

*** Buffer Name

=uniquify-buffer-name-style= setting controls how Emacs handles the naming of
buffers displaying files containing the same name; for example
=~/dir/subdir_1/file.el= and and =~/dir/subdir_2/file.el=.

Setting to ~'forward~ displays the name as a truncated file-path in order to
distinguish between files; resulting in =subdir_1/file.el= and =subdir_2/file.el=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt uniquify-buffer-name-style 'forward)
#+end_src

** Minibuffer

The following recommendations are suggested by the creator of the =vertico.el=
package (see [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][github/vertico]])

*** Recursive Minibuffer
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       dfe5aad6-6c0b-4e06-8c83-028a59bb9ad1
:END:

=enable-recursive-minibuffers=, when set to ~t~ allows us to enter multiple
minibuffer commands consecutively without closing the previous one. This is
useful when accessing information while already in a minibuffer prompt.

*Example Use-Case:* Checking another file's path in the middle of a ~M-x find-file~
prompt. Possible to call ~M-x~ again, open another minibuffer, check what we
need, and then return to the initial minibuffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
#+end_src

*** Read-only Minibuffer
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bbc9b953-b553-4928-a0ef-daf6df48a1f8
:END:

The minibuffer-prompt is not meant to be edited. Setting
=minibuffer-prompt-properties= to read-only and hooking the built-in
=cursor-intangible-mode= prevents accidental modifications of the prompt text.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt minibuffer-prompt-properties
        '(read-only t cursor-intangible t face minibuffer-prompt))

(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'cursor-intangible-mode)
#+end_src

*N.B.* If ~(setopt minibuffer-prompt-properties nil)~ and we call ~M-x~, possible to
modify the "M-x" by moving the cursor back and deleting "M", "-", and/or
"x". _Not ideal_.

*** Make C-g a Bit More Helpful
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       51c833dd-b403-40e5-8359-f3b6f15193ff
:END:

By default, the function =keyboard-quit= only closes the minibuffer if the cursor
is inside the minibuffer-window. That is annoying. The following adds some
quality-of-life refinement.

*Source:* [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-11-28-basic-emacs-configuration/#h:1e468b2a-9bee-4571-8454-e3f5462d9321][protesilaos.com/basic-emacs-configuration]]

- When the region is active, disable it.  When a minibuffer is
- open, but not focused, close the minibuffer.  When the
- Completions buffer is selected, close it.  In every other case
- use the regular `keyboard-quit'."

** Cursor
*** Cursor Style

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default cursor-type 'bar)
#+end_src

** Mouse/Scrolling
*** Precision Scrolling

=pixel-scroll-precision-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated,
provides a smoother, more precise scrolling experience. Scrolling occurs by
pixel and not by larger fixed amounts like whole lines or pages.

*N.B.* Recommended by [[https://tony-zorman.com/posts/emacs-potpourri.html][tony-zorman.com]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Display Line Numbers in Fringe
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       253507fc-cbf8-40a5-a490-c8651a7d44dd
:END:

=display-line-numbers= is an Emacs package providing =display-line-numbers-mode=
that, when activated, displays the line number on the left side of the buffer.

By default, the fringe is not a fix amount so code on line ~1_000~ will appear
slightly indented from code on line ~1~. To prevent this,
=display-line-numbers-width= is set to ~4~ as we do not anticipate working on files
longer than ~9_999~ lines.

*N.B.* See =global-display-line-numbers-mode=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

:END:
:RELATED:
+ [[id:c955493b-ad4d-4661-ba0a-ad79ce52dbc4][Cleanup White Spaces]] :: See =whitespace-line-column=
:END:

=fill-column= setting specifies the maximum width (ie number of columns) of the
buffer before text is wrapped, or filled, to the next line. Setting to ~79~ to
comply with =PEP8= style guide.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt fill-column 79)
#+end_src

*** Visual Line Wrapping

=global-visual-line-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, enables
visual line wrapping across all buffers. Lines that exceed the width of the
frame are automatically wrapped.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-visual-line-mode 1)

;; Break at whitespace, not middle of word
(setopt word-wrap t)
#+end_src

*** Overwrite Active Region

=delete-selection-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, replaces
or overwrites the selected region. This behavior is similar to most text
editors. Deactivated by default, Emacs will paste/enter text _after_ the selected
region. *Annoying*.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Replace active region when typing text
(delete-selection-mode 1)
#+end_src

*** Automatic Buffer Reloading

=global-auto-revert-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when
activated,automatically reloads buffers when the underlying file changes on
disk. This is particularly useful when open files change should we switch =git=
branches.

** White Space
*** Indicate Empty Lines

=indicate-empty-lines= setting, when set to ~t~, highlights empty lines in the
buffer. Later, we will configure the automatic removal of empty lines.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt indicate-empty-lines t)
#+end_src

*** Cleanup White Spaces
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c955493b-ad4d-4661-ba0a-ad79ce52dbc4
:END:

=whitespace= is a /built-int/ Emacs package providing =whitespace-mode= that, when
activated, highlights white-spaces in buffers; the package also includes
=whitespace-cleanup-mode= which automatically removes white-spaces.

*N.B.* [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhiteSpace][Emacswiki]] provides a nice overview of the settings.

=whitespace-style= setting specifies /which/ white-spaces are visualized:
  + face :: Visualize spaces by changing =face= color (instead of in table)
  + trailing :: Flag trailing white-space
  + lines-tail :: Columns beyond ~whitespace-line-column~ are
    highlighted via faces (must exclude =lines= in our configuration).
  + empty :: Flag empty lines (only at beginning/end of buffer)
  + indentation::space :: Flag ~TABs~ at beginning of lines
  + space-before-tab::tab :: Flag extra ~SPC~ before ~TAB~

*N.B.* =fill-column= previously set in [[id:6881fadb-9439-4939-974c-e50265bd8a0a][Buffer Column Width]] section.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

                      space-before-tab::tab))
  :config
  (global-whitespace-mode 0))
#+end_src

** Indentation
*** Indentation Width

=tab-width= setting specifies the number of spaces a single ~TAB~
represents. Alternatively, =standard-indent= setting sets the number of spaces
for Emacs commands that do not have a specific indentation width set. For
consistency, we define and set both variables to =my-indent-width=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq my-indent-width 4)
(setq-default tab-width my-indent-width
              standard-indent my-indent-width)
#+end_src

*** Tab Behavior
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       925b16ea-4f78-49ca-93db-0012b84ca33f
:END:

=tab-always-indent= setting specifies the behavior of ~TAB~. This is particularly
relevant in programming modes. Setting to ~'complete~ results in ~TAB~ first
attempting to indent the line (if the line is already properly indented);
otherwise ~TAB~ will trigger code completion instead (if available).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default tab-always-indent 'complete)
#+end_src

*** Indent Using Spaces

=indent-tabs-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, specifies that
indentation _can_ insert ~\t~ characters. Setting to ~nil~ deactivate the mode, thus
~\s~ is used; as recommended in the =PEP8= style guide, removing discrepancies that
may occur between different text editors or IDEs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+end_src

** History
*** Window Layout History

=winner-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, tracks changes to
window layouts (ie splits, closing, resizing, etc). Changes are stored in
=winner-ring-alist=. The mode includes two functions for undoing and redoing
changes to the window:

+ winner-undo :: Default ~C-c <left>~ to revert window layout
+ winner-redo :: Default ~C-c <right>~ to redo the previously undone change

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(winner-mode 1)
#+end_src

*** Minibuffer History
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e010f1a6-c723-4ca1-bf39-62b3a9672797
:END:

=savehist-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, saves the
minibuffer history (ie commands, file-names, search history, etc) across Emacs
sessions. Minibuffer history saved in =savehist.el= (see =savehist-file= variable),
whose location is modified by the =no-litter= package (see [[id:a0a6ce0f-55d9-415f-a70c-48716e9d8c61][Tidy Emacs Directory]]).

*N.B.* Recommended by the creator of the =vertico.el= ([[https://github.com/minad/vertico][github/vertico]]).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(savehist-mode 1)
#+end_src

*** Cursor Position History

=saveplace-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, saves the cursor
position in a given file; if previously visited, the cursor will move to the
last known position. Cursor positions saved in =save-place.el= (see
=save-place-file= variable), whose location is modified by the =no-litter= package
(see [[id:a0a6ce0f-55d9-415f-a70c-48716e9d8c61][Tidy Emacs Directory]]).

*N.B.* Suggested in [[https://www.jamescherti.com/essential-emacs-packages/][jamescherti.com]] blog-post.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(save-place-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Prompting
*** Lazy Prompt Response

=use-short-answers= setting, when set to ~t~, allows users to respond to
confirmation prompts with simple ~y~ or ~n~ (instead of typing the full words).

The functions =yes-or-no-p= and =y-or-n-p= are effectively the same, however the
former requires full ~yes~ or ~no~ answers. Here, we effectively replace the
function with =y-or-no-p= so that single letter answers may be used across all
prompts.

*N.B.* Suggested in [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/disabling-prompts-emacs][masteringemacs.org]] article.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt use-short-answers t)
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+end_src

*** Disable New File Confirmation

=confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer= setting, when set to ~nil~, disables user
confirmation before visiting a new file or buffer.

*N.B.* Suggested in [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/disabling-prompts-emacs][masteringemacs.org]] article.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer nil)
#+end_src

*** CRM Prompt Indicator

The custom function ~crm-indicator~ adds an indicator to the completion prompt
when using ~completing-read-multiple~. This makes it easier to visualize multiple
inputs.

*N.B.* Suggested by the creator of the =vertico.el= package ([[https://github.com/minad/vertico][github/vertico]]).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/crm-indicator (args)
  "Add indicator to completion promp when using 'completing-read-multiple'"
  (cons (format "[CRM%s] %s"
                (replace-regexp-in-string
                 "\\`\\[.*?]\\*\\|\\[.*?]\\*\\'" ""
                 crm-separator)
                (car args))
        (cdr args)))

(advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :filter-args #'my/crm-indicator)
#+end_src

For example, calling the example function ~test-crm-indicator~ indicates that
selecting multiple options is both possible using a comma-separator.

*N.B.* src-block not tangled to configuration file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defun test-crm-indicator ()
  "A custom function using completing-read-multiple."

*** Cursor When Switching Buffers

=beacon= is an Emacs package providing =beacon-mode= minor-mode that, when
activated, highlights (flashes) the line containing the cursor when changing
current buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package beacon
  :defer t
  :hook (after-init . beacon-mode))
#+end_src

*** Matching Delimiter Pairs

=paren= is a /built-in/ Emacs package providing =show-paren-mode= that, when
activated, highlights matching pairs of parentheses/delimiters when the cursor
is positioned at a delimiter. Several settings should be mentioned:

+ show-paren-style :: ~'parenthesis~ to only highlight delimiter
  - ~'expression~ highlights the entire enclosed text
+ show-paren-context-when-offscreen :: ~'overlay~
  - Overlay popup provides additional context if matching pair off screen

*N.B.* The /built-in/ minor-mode =electric-pair-mode= is also activated, which
automatically inserts a closing delimiter.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package paren
  :defer t
  :custom
  (show-paren-style 'parenthesis "Only highlight ()")
  (show-paren-when-point-inside-paren t)
  (show-paren-when-point-in-periphery t)
  ;; If cursor on ), show overlay for (
  (show-paren-context-when-offscreen 'overlay)
  :config
  (show-paren-mode 1))

(use-package elec-pair
  :defer t
  :config (electric-pair-mode 1)
  :custom
  ;; Prevent closing pair if POINT at beginning or middle of word
  (electric-pair-inhibit-predicate 'electric-pair-conservative-inhibit))
#+end_src

*** Symbols/Things at Point

=highlight-thing= is an Emacs package providing =highlight-thing-mode= that, when
activated, automatically highlights all visible occurrences of the symbol/thing
at point.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package highlight-thing
  :hook ((prog-mode . highlight-thing-mode)
         (org-mode . highlight-thing-mode))

     "import", "from", "in", "def", "class")))
#+end_src

*** Line at Point

=global-hl-line-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated, highlights
the current line (see related =hl-line-mode=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-hl-line-mode 1)
#+end_src

*** Pulse Killed Region

The custom function, copied from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ9JE9kRwG8][youtube/gopar]], highlights (pulses) the current
region and is executed before =kill-ring-save=, making it easier to visualize
what text/region is being copied.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gopar/pulse-current-region (&rest _)
  "Pulse the current implicit or active region"
  (if mark-active
      (pulse-momentary-highlight-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
    (pulse-momentary-highlight-region (mark) (point))))

(advice-add #'kill-ring-save :before #'gopar/pulse-current-region)
#+end_src

** Files + Encoding
*** Automatically Revert Buffer

=global-auto-revert-mode= is a /built-in/ minor-mode that, when activated,
automatically refreshes the contents of buffers after the visited file changes
on disk. This ensures buffers are automatically updated after changing =git=
branches.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode)
#+end_src

*** Encoding

[[https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-utf-8][UTF-8]] is central to the storage and encoding of text and files. Although other
encoding systems exist, =utf-8= is practically a standard, at least in the West,
and so it is important that we instruct Emacs to treat files as UTF-8 by
default. For more information, read [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/working-coding-systems-unicode-emacs][MasteringEmacs]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/working-coding-systems-unicode-emacs

;; https://github.com/Thaodan/emacs.d
(define-coding-system-alias 'UTF-8 'utf-8)
#+end_src

** Boookmarks

=bookmark= is a /built-in/ Emacs package providing users the ability to efficiently
store and access specific locations in frequently visited files. Bookmarks are
saved in =bookmarks-default.el= (see =bookmark-file= variable), whose location is
modified by the =no-litter= package (see [[id:a0a6ce0f-55d9-415f-a70c-48716e9d8c61][Tidy Emacs Directory]]).

Frequently used functions include:

+ bookmark-set :: ~C-x r m~; Set bookmark at current location
  - Prompt user for desired name of bookmark
  - Bookmarked locations indicated by flag in fringe of buffer
  - Bookmark details stored in =bookmark-alist=

+ bookmark-jump :: ~C-x r b~; Select bookmark and jump to location

+ bookmark-save :: Export =bookmark-alist= to specified file

+ bookmark-delete :: Delete bookmark in =bookmark-alist=

+ bookmark-bmenu-list :: Open buffer containing all bookmarks

*N.B.* Related, the =register= package is a temporary alternative where locations
are assigned to a single character (and do not persist in memory). Something to
explore in the future.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Ediff

=ediff-split-window-function= setting controls how Emacs splits the window when

ensures that the buffers are side by side from each other.

=ediff-window-setup-function= setting controls how =ediff= mananges the window
layout in Emacs. Setting to ~'ediff-setup-windows-plain~ ensures that both =ediff=
windows are open in the current Emacs frame.

*** TODO Font Style

In Emacs, fonts can be customized to improve readability and visually organize
different content types such as code, prose, or user interfaces. Three common
font types include:

+ default :: Primary font used if no other specifications are provided
+ fixed-pitch :: Mono-spaced (fixed-width) text typically used in programming
+ variable-pitch :: Proportional fonts often used in =org-mode=

This configuration uses the =Jetbrains Mono= font, which is manually downloaded
from [[https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/][jetbrains.com]]. The font was installed by following the [[https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#how-to-install][how-to]] instructions

*** Font Size

In Emacs, the face attribute ~:height~ is a measurement in units of ~0.1~ of a
point. For example, setting the height to ~120~ means a 12-point =font-size=. The
custom function =set-font-size= enables the user to change the font w.r.t. the
more common =font-size=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Modified from https://stackoverflow.com/a/50052751
(defun fonts (fontsize)
  "Set the font-pt size."
  (interactive "nFont size: ")
  (let* ((font-height (* 10 fontsize)))
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height font-height)
    (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :height font-height)
    (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :height font-height)))

** Icons

=nerd-icons= is an Emacs package that provides icons for use in Emacs
buffers. The use of icons improve readability, for example in the minibuffer
icons are displayed next to the file name indicating whether the file is an
=org=, =python=, or =elisp= file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Modeline
*** Mood-line

=doom-modeline= is the most feature-rich mode-line package for Emacs. For some
reason the right end of the mode-line would be cut off so I could not see the
repo name. Instead, defer to =mood-line=, the lightweight alternative to
=doom-modeline=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Spacious Padding

=spacious-padding-mode= increases the space or "padding" around several elements
of the Emacs interface, such as window dividers, the internal frame border, and

** Org Table of Contents

=org-make-tock= is an Emacs package providing =org-make-toc-mode= that, when
activated, generates a "Table of Contents" (=TOC=) for =org= files. This makes it
easier to navigate large documents. Calling ~org-make-toc-insert~ adds a custom
~:TOC:~ property to the current header. The function ~org-make-toc~ updates the =TOC=
in the current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*N.B.* ~org-startup-indented t~ is set in the [[id:1ef23429-c87a-4921-8dfc-f3169a907451][General Settings]] section. Doing so
disables the fringe area of the block and "bracket" provided by =org-modern= (see
[[https://github.com/jdtsmith/org-modern-indent][org-modern-indent]]). Personally, I found the brackets distracting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

*** Hide Emphasis Markers

By default, =Doom Themes= stylizes text surrounded by emphasis markers (see [[id:671dbaef-69f8-4ea6-870f-a72ebf5e13d7][Doom

minor-mode =org-appear-mode= reveals the markers if the cursor moves in between
marker pairs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Org Behavior
*** Speed Commands

=org-use-speed-commands= settings controls whether certain single-key shortcuts
known as /speed commands/ are enabled when the cursor is at the beginning of a
headline. Below, we set the value to a custom lambda function (copied from
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/ded3g8/comment/f2x1u1o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button][reddit]]) that enables the use of speed commands if cursor is on _any_ of the
leading stars.

*N.B.* If ~non-nil~, move cursor to start of any headline and call ~?~ to view list
of available speed commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Add Org-Block Templates

An =org-block= is a special section of text and possess syntax that distinguish
it from the surrounding content. Though there are many types of =org-blocks=,
they all share the same structure and start/end with ~#+BEGIN_<type>~ and
~#+END_<type>~.

Due to the shared structure, it is possible to define custom blocks via the
=org-structure-template-alist= setting and insert by calling
=org-insert-structure-template= (~C-c C-,~). Here, we define a few block templates
we anticipate using frequently.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt org-structure-template-alist
        '(("x" . "example")
          ("q" . "quote")
          ("e" . "src emacs-lisp")

**** Window Setup

=org-src-window-setup= setting controls how the source code edit buffer is

#+end_src

**** Turn off Exit Prompt

=org-src-ask-before-returning-to-edit-buffer= setting, when ~t~, prompts the user
before returning to an active source code editing buffer. This prevents
conflicting changes should the user switch back to the current buffer and make
changes to the =src-block= of an active =org-edit-special= buffer.

** Org-Agenda
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       17a0becd-af6d-47b9-8979-296bbdfa0f36
:END:
*** Background

=Org-agenda= is a tool in =org= for viewing, managing, and organizing tasks,
appointments, and/or projects. =Org-agenda= files (~.org~) are the source from
which the agenda extracts information, and are specified by defining
~org-agenda-files~.

Within an =org-agenda= file, header levels are used to structure content
hierarchically. The hierarchy makes it easy to break tasks into manageable
parts, with lower levels inheriting context from higher ones. For example a
TODO item under a project heading naturally belongs to that project.

Related, it is possible to define =org-capture= templates to standardize the
definition of -- and quickly insert -- TODO items.

*** Approach
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d8b34f34-e59a-4ac7-8184-58bbe224c9b9
:END:

I intend to use =org-agenda= to track the progress of ongoing personal- and
work-related TODO =tasks= or =projects=.

Here, a =task= is a TODO item with an individual deliverable such as "Review
Merge Request" or "Add Package X to Emacs Config". A =task= like "Review Merge
Request" may require multiple steps, like reviewing individual files.

Alternatively, a =project= is a goal that requires the completion of multiple
deliverables (i.e. =tasks=). For example, a =project= may include "Deploy an ML
model" which requires the sequential completion of "Perform EDA",
"Train/Evaluate ML Model", and "Build API"; each would require their own merge
request. A =project= is defined as a top-level header and related =tasks= will be
filed as second-level headers.

For the sake of simplicity, I delineate TODO items as either related to
"personal" or "work" and store them accordingly in =agenda_personal.org= and
=agenda_work.org=. These agenda files are stored in the variable ~my-persist-dir~
directory previously defined in the [[id:a0a6ce0f-55d9-415f-a70c-48716e9d8c61][Tidy Emacs Directory]] section.

_Carefully organizing TODO headers seems tedious_. Instead, this configuration
defines numerous =org-agenda= "views" to parse and group =tasks= and/or
=projects=. This is made possible through the configuration and use of:

+ TODO state :: Defines "action" state of the item
  - TODO states will be consistent across agenda files
  - Example :: ~TODO~, ~ACTIVE~, ~HOLD/WAIT~, ~COMPLETE~, ~MERGED~, ~DROPPED~
  - Example :: ~REVIEW~, ~COMMENT~, ~MESSAGE~

+ Tags :: Define "subject"-specific context to task
  - File Tag :: Tag defined in ~org-agenda-files~
    * Example :: ~:personal:~ and ~:work:~
  - Subject Tag :: Tag defined generally in config
    * Example :: ~bug~, ~note~, ~emacs~, ~devtools~, ~project~

+ Org-Header Property :: Header properties provide additional context
  - ~:project:~ + =org-super-agenda= package used to organize =tasks= belonging to a
    single =project=
  - Other properties may log ~:git_issue:~, ~:branch:~, or ~:repo:~

=Org-capture= templates are used to quickly insert =task= and =project= items. *N.B.*
Calling ~M-x org-refile~ (~C-c C-w~) instead of ~C-c C-c~ will "re-file" a =task= item
under a =project= top-level header.

:ID:       4482073c-1c7e-4457-b196-cd38e1471f05

*** Agenda Window Behavior

=org-agenda-window-setup= setting specifies how the agenda buffer should be

#+end_src

*** Agenda TODO Settings
**** Agenda TODO Keywords

=org-todo-keywords= variable defines list(s) of TODO entry keyword sequences and
their interpretation. Calling ~M-x org-todo~ (~C-c C-t~) inserts or changes the
keyword of the =org= header at point.

Special characters assigned to the keyword include:

+ alpha :: Fast-state selection of keyword, configured in [[id:4f1ecc02-a588-4162-8f00-6d391e10bd4d][Fast TODO Selection]]
+ @ :: Add note and time to state change
+ ! :: Record only the time of the state change

The logging behavior of notes and timestamps are configured in [[id:c2de3b63-12ca-4c34-921c-0c518665eb40][Agenda TODO
Logging]].

*N.B.* The ~"|"~ keyword signifies that the subsequent keywords are a terminal
state. In other words, no further action is necessary.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO(t!)"
                                      "ACTIVE(a!)"

**** Hierarchical TODO Statistics

As outlined in [[id:d8b34f34-e59a-4ac7-8184-58bbe224c9b9][Approach]], project-related =tasks= are organized in top-level
=project= headers. It is possible to display the fraction or percentage of
completed project-related tasks by adding ~[/]~ or ~[%]~ in the top-level
header. *N.B.* I include this in the =org-capture-templates=; see [[id:7fbf08ac-d4c9-4605-9f44-94570c2a7273][Agenda Capture
Templates]].

The following is copied from [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Breaking-Down-Tasks.html][orgmode.org]] to automatically change a =project= TODO
entry to DONE when all children =tasks= are completed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Agenda TAG Settings
**** Fast Tag Selection

Similar to [[id:4f1ecc02-a588-4162-8f00-6d391e10bd4d][Fast TODO Selection]], setting =org-use-fast-tag-selection= to ~'auto~
opens a TAG pop-um menu when calling ~M-x org-set-tags-command~ (~C-c C-q~).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt org-use-fast-tag-selection 'auto)
#+end_src

**** Tag Keywords

=org-tag-alist= variable defines list of TAG keywords. Calling ~M-x
org-set-tags-command~ (~C-c C-q~) sets the tags for the current visible entry.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setopt org-tag-alist

By default, =org-use-tag-inheritance= is set to ~t~. Therefore, second-level =task=
items will inherit tags assigned to the top-level =project= header. Mentioned in
[[id:d8b34f34-e59a-4ac7-8184-58bbe224c9b9][Approach]], a =project= TODO is defined as a top-level header and related =tasks=
will be filed as second-level headers. I intend to use the ~:project:~ tag to
define =project= TODO. Adding ~:project:~ to =org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance=
setting provides a way to delineate between =project= TODO and related =task=
items.

=vertico= is an Emacs package providing =vertico-mode= that, when activated,
provides an efficient completion framework that enhances Emacs' built-in
minibuffer completion. Completion candidates are displayed vertically in the
minibuffer.

The package includes several extensions:

+ vertico-directory :: Convenient directory navigation commands
+ vertico-repeat :: Command to repeat last completion session
+ vertico-grid :: Display candidates in grid, not as list
+ vertico-multiform :: Control display of candidates per mode

** Orderless

=orderless= is an Emacs package that enhances completion style in the minibuffer
by allowing flexible, non-sequential matching on input patters. For example, if

** Yasnippet

=yasnippets= is a 3rd party Emacs package that provides a powerful snippet
template system. Snippets are stored in =~/.emacs.d/snippets/= and can be

The =consult-yasnippet= Emacs package expands [[id:8b393fcc-9d43-4afb-b249-9a72bc6089ea][Consult]] and provides consult-read
interface for snippets. Calling ~M-x consult-yasnippet~ will display all snippets
(and their ~key:~) available for the current mode.

*** Tweaks for CLI Git in Emacs

Command-line =git= is possible in =vterm=, however editing =EDITMSG= buffers can be
tedious. Since ~core.editor vim~ is set by default, =vim= bindings are required to
edit the message buffer. However, setting ~core.editor "emacs"~ will open the
=EDITMSG= buffer as a new window instead of in the current Emacs
instance. *Annoying!*

Alternatively we can install the =with-editor= package (part of =magit=) to open
the =EDITMSG= buffer inside the current Emacs instance and set ~git config
--global core.editor "emacsclient"~ to use Emacs bindings when editing the
message. See [[https://magit.vc/manual/with-editor/Using-With_002dEditor-commands.html][magit.vc/manual/with-editor]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package with-editor
  :after (vterm magit)

** Lisp
*** Automatic Indentation

=aggressive-indent= is an Emacs package providing =aggressive-indent-mode= that,
when activated, correctly indents code as you type. Changes to indentation on
one line of a function, for example, automatically adjusts the remaining lines
of code. Primarily used as a "dumb" formatter for =emacs-lisp= code.

*N.B.* Less important for =python= as other code formatter packages exist.

** Python
*** Basics

=python.el= is a /built-in/ Emacs package providing =python-mode= for editing python
files. The major-mode provides some fontification as well as syntax
highlighting, indentation, and movement functions.

*N.B.* The package also provides =inferior-python-mode= which runs a Python
interpreter (python shell) as a sub-process of Emacs. The =inferior python
process= does not contain fontification and cannot display images. This
configuration will instead rely on =Jupyter Kernels= (see [[id:4d2b331f-7ced-46b2-a764-db4ff2b79688][Jupyter REPLS]]).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Virtual Environments
**** Add Executable Path

The =exec-path-from-shell= package is a tool to ensure that Emacs correctly
inherits environment variables such as ~$PATH~ (bash convention) from your
shell. This is particularly relevant as we wish to make Emacs, and =eglot=, aware
of our =tool= virtual environment containing python applications. It is necessary
to add the =venv= path to ~exec-path~ as the applications will serve as the
back-end for various Emacs packages that provide, for instance, code formatting
or LSP functionality.

*** Doc-strings

=numpydoc= is an Emacs package to easily insert [[https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html][NumPy]] style doc-strings in Python
function definitions. Alternatively, =sphinx-doc= makes it easier to insert
[[https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html][Sphinx]] style doc-strings.

*N.B.* Keybindings for ~numpydoc-generate~ and ~sphinx-doc~ assigned in [[id:d831e4e4-e9b1-480e-aa1a-a152d9707275][General.el]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Spell Checking
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8a9a6083-929e-4329-b009-c33529b0e5a7
:END:

Spell checking is important for both things like narratives and git
commits. The [[https://github.com/minad/jinx][jinx]] package is preferred over the builtin =flyspell= due to
efficiency, keybindings, and ability to save words to a dictionary.

The package uses the API of the =Enchant= library [[[https://abiword.github.io/enchant/][github/enchant]]] and only
analyses visible text (instead of the entire buffer). The =jinx= package requires
the following local packages to provide spell-checking. Both =enchant= and
=pkgconf= are Arch-specific. Dictionaries are provided by =nuspell= (the modern
version of =hunspell=). See [[https://github.com/minad/jinx][gitub/jinx]] for more details. In Arch, packages can be
download by ~yay enchant pkgconf hunspell~.

  + hunspell :: Spell-checker dictionaries
  + enchant :: Wrapper for spelling libraries
  + pkgconf :: Compiler; used by =jinx= to locate =enchant=

Useful commands include:
  + jinx-next / jinx-previous :: Jump to previous/next visible
    spelling error
  + jinx-correct-all :: Allow user to correct all spelling errors in
    buffer

*QUIRK:* Comments in =src-blocks= are only checked if viewed in an =org-edit-special=
buffer accessed via ~C-c '~ . This is because =jinx= only checks text possessing
specific face properties (see ~jinx-include-faces~ and ~jinx-exclude-faces~). When
coding, we are only interested in checking comments and doc-strings;
~tree-sitter-hl-face:comment~, for example extends this functionality to =.py=
files. To check a comment, we would need to remove =org-block= in
~jinx-exclude-faces~ at the expense of checking ALL of the code.

*** Update dblocks Before Saving

=denote= takes advantage of dynamic =org-blocks= to dynamically organize links and
back-links. Annoyingly, they must be manually updated. Here, we add a hook to
update dynamic blocks before saving the =denote= buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'before-save-hook (lambda ()
                              (when (denote-file-is-note-p (buffer-file-name))
                                (org-update-all-dblocks))))

=consult-denote= is an Emacs accessory package for =denote= that extends the
preview-functionality of =consult=.  The package provides the following
functions:

+ consult-denote-find :: Alternative to ~denote-open-or-create~
+ consult-denote-grep :: Regex to filter files in =denote-directory=

*** auctex

=auctex= is an advanced editing environment for =LaTeX= and other =TeX=-related
formats in Emacs. Functionality provided includes syntax highlighting, command
completion, document navigation, error parsing, and preview functionality. *N.B.*
Prerequisites include:

+ texlive-most :: Collection of tools, programs, and libraries for =TeX= files
+ pdflatex :: =LaTex= engine that produces PDF files from ~.tex~ source files
+ ghostscript :: For operation of =preview-latex= in both =DVI=- and =PDF=-mode
+ mupdf :: lightweight PDF viewer (useful for previewing)

According to the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/doc/auctex.html][documentation]], the following settings are recommended in order
to get support for many of the LaTeX packages commonly used in documents:
+ TeX-auto-save t :: Enable parse on save
+ TeX-parse-self t :: Enable parse on load
+ TeX-master nil :: Make =auctex= aware of multi-file document structure

Useful commands include:
+ M-x tex-compile :: Compile =.tex= buffer and view in PDF
+ M-x LaTeX-section :: ~C-c C-s~ to insert a template for a =LaTeX= section
+ M-x TeX-error-overview :: To see formatted list of compiler errors/warnings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

*** pdf-tools

=pdf-tools= is an Emacs package extension that enhances PDF viewing and
interaction within Emacs. Instead of using an external view like =Zathura=, it
enables viewing and interacting within PDFs inside an Emacs buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

** Which-Key

=which-key= is an Emacs package providing the minor-mode =which-key-mode= that,
when activated, displays the available keybindings following an incomplete
command [[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][github/whichkey]]]. For example, typing ~C-x~ will open a window showing
available keybindings (and descriptions) sharing the ~C-x~ prefix.

*N.B.* After popup window appears, use ~C-h~ to open additional navigation
options. This is helpful not all keybindings can fit in the popup window.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package which-key
  :config (which-key-mode)
  :custom
  (which-key-show-early-on-C-h t     "Trigger which-key manually")
