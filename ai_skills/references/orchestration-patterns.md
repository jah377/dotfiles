# Orchestration Patterns

Reference catalog of agent orchestration patterns this repo endorses, plus anti-patterns to avoid. Read this before adding a new slash command that coordinates multiple personas, or before introducing a new persona that "wraps" existing ones.

The governing rule: **the user (or a slash command) is the orchestrator. Personas do not invoke other personas.** Skills are mandatory hops inside a persona's workflow.

---

## Endorsed patterns

### 1. Direct invocation (no orchestration)

Single persona, single perspective, single artifact. The default and the cheapest option.

```
user → code-reviewer → report → user
```

**Use when:** the work is one perspective on one artifact and you can describe it in one sentence.

**Examples:**
- "Review this PR" → `code-reviewer`
- "What tests are missing for this function?" → `test-engineer`

**Cost:** one round trip. The baseline you should always compare orchestrated patterns against.

---

### 2. Single-persona slash command

A slash command that wraps one persona with the project's skills. Saves the user from re-explaining the workflow every time.

```
/review → code-reviewer (with code-review-and-quality skill) → report
```

**Use when:** the same single-persona invocation happens repeatedly with the same setup.

**Examples in this repo:** `/review`, `/test`, `/code-simplify`.

**Cost:** same as direct invocation. The slash command is just a saved prompt.

**Anti-signal:** if the slash command's body is mostly "decide which persona to call," delete it and let the user call the persona directly.

---

### 3. Parallel fan-out with merge

Multiple personas operate on the same input concurrently, each producing an independent report. A merge step (in the main agent's context) synthesizes them into a single decision.

```
                         ┌─→ code-reviewer ─┐
/review → fan out  ──────┤                  ├→ merge → go/no-go
                         └─→ test-engineer ─┘
```

**Use when:**
- The sub-tasks are genuinely independent (no shared mutable state, no ordering dependency)
- Each sub-agent benefits from its own context window
- The merge step is small enough to stay in the main context
- Wall-clock latency matters

**Cost:** N parallel sub-agent contexts + one merge turn. Higher than direct invocation, but faster wall-clock and produces better reports because each sub-agent stays focused on its single perspective.

**Validation checklist before adopting this pattern:**
- [ ] Can I run all sub-agents at the same time without ordering issues?
- [ ] Does each persona produce a different *kind* of finding, not just the same finding from a different angle?
- [ ] Will the merge step fit in the main agent's remaining context?
- [ ] Is the user's wait time long enough that parallelism is actually noticeable?

If any answer is "no," fall back to direct invocation or a single-persona command.

### 4. Sequential pipeline as user-driven slash commands

The user runs slash commands in a defined order, carrying context (or commit history) between them. There is no orchestrator agent — the user IS the orchestrator.

```
user runs:  /spec  →  /plan  →  /build  →  /test  →  /review
```

**Use when:** the workflow has dependencies (each step needs the previous step's output) and human judgment between steps adds value.

**Examples in this repo:** the entire DEFINE → PLAN → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW lifecycle.

**Cost:** one sub-agent context per step. Free for the orchestration layer because there is no orchestrator agent.

**Why not automate it:** an LLM "lifecycle orchestrator" would (a) lose nuance between steps because it has to summarize for hand-off, (b) skip the human checkpoints that catch wrong-direction work early, and (c) double the token cost via paraphrasing turns.

---

### 5. Research isolation (context preservation)

When a task requires reading large amounts of material that shouldn't pollute the main context, spawn a research sub-agent that returns only a digest.

```
main agent → research sub-agent (reads 50 files) → digest → main agent continues
```

**Use when:**
- The main session needs to stay focused on a downstream task
- The investigation result is much smaller than the input it consumes
- The decision quality benefits from the main agent having room to think after

**Examples:** "Find every call site of this deprecated API across the monorepo," "Summarize what these 30 ADRs say about caching."

**Cost:** one isolated sub-agent context. Worth it any time the alternative is loading hundreds of files into the main context.

**On Claude Code, use the built-in `Explore` subagent** rather than defining a custom research persona. `Explore` runs on Haiku, is denied write/edit tools, and is purpose-built for this pattern. Define a custom research subagent only when `Explore` doesn't fit (e.g. you need a domain-specific system prompt the model wouldn't infer).

## Claude Code compatibility

This catalog is harness-agnostic, but most readers will run it on Claude Code. Here's how each pattern maps onto Claude Code's primitives — and where the platform enforces our rules for us.

### Where personas live

Plugin subagents go in `agents/` at the plugin root. This repo is a plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), so `agents/code-reviewer.md` and `agents/test-engineer.md` are auto-discovered when the plugin is enabled. No path configuration needed.

### Subagents vs. Agent Teams

Claude Code has two parallelism primitives. Pattern 3 (parallel fan-out with merge) maps to **subagents**. If you need teammates that talk to each other, use **Agent Teams** instead.

| | Subagents | Agent Teams |
|--|-----------|-------------|
| Coordination | Main agent fans out, sub-agents only report back | Teammates message each other, share a task list |
| Context | Own context window per subagent | Own context window per teammate |
| When to use | Independent tasks producing reports | Collaborative work needing discussion |
| Status | Stable | Experimental — requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` |
| Cost | Lower | Higher — each teammate is a separate Claude instance |

**The personas in this repo work in both modes.** When spawned as subagents, they report findings to the main session. When spawned as teammates, they can challenge each other's findings directly. The persona definition is the same; only the spawning context changes.

### Platform-enforced rules

Two rules in this catalog aren't just convention — Claude Code enforces them:

- **"Subagents cannot spawn other subagents"** (verbatim from the docs). Anti-pattern B (persona-calls-persona) and Anti-pattern D (deep persona trees) cannot exist on Claude Code by construction.
- **"No nested teams"** — teammates cannot spawn their own teams. Same anti-patterns blocked at the team level.

### Built-in subagents to know about

Before defining a custom subagent, check whether one of these covers the role:

| Built-in | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Explore` | Read-only codebase search and analysis. Use this for Pattern 5 (research isolation). |
| `Plan` | Read-only research during plan mode. |
| `general-purpose` | Multi-step tasks needing both exploration and modification. |

Don't redefine these. Layer specialist personas (`code-reviewer`, `test-engineer`) on top of them.

## Anti-patterns

### A. Router persona ("meta-orchestrator")

A persona whose job is to decide which other persona to call.

**Why it fails:**
- Pure routing layer with no domain value
- Adds two paraphrasing hops → information loss + roughly 2× token cost
- The user already knew they wanted a review; they could have called `/review` directly

**What to do instead:** add or refine slash commands.

---

### B. Persona that calls another persona

**Why it fails:**
- Personas were designed to produce a single perspective; chaining them defeats that
- The summary the calling persona passes loses context the called persona needs
- Hides cost from the user

**What to do instead:** have the calling persona *recommend* a follow-up audit in its report.

---

### C. Sequential orchestrator that paraphrases

**Why it fails:**
- Loses the human checkpoints that catch wrong-direction work
- Each hand-off summarizes context — accumulated drift over a long pipeline
- Doubles token cost: orchestrator turn + sub-agent turn for every step

**What to do instead:** keep the user as the orchestrator.

---

### D. Deep persona trees

**Why it fails:**
- Each layer adds latency and tokens with no decision value
- The leaf personas lose context to multiple summarization steps

**What to do instead:** keep orchestration depth at most 1 (slash command → personas).

---

## Decision flow

When considering a new orchestrated workflow, walk this flow:

```
Is the work one perspective on one artifact?
├── Yes → Direct invocation. Stop.
└── No  → Will the same composition repeat?
         ├── No  → Direct invocation, ad hoc. Stop.
         └── Yes → Are sub-tasks independent?
                  ├── No  → Sequential slash commands run by user (Pattern 4).
                  └── Yes → Parallel fan-out with merge (Pattern 3).
                           Validate against the checklist above.
                           If any check fails → fall back to single-persona command (Pattern 2).
```
